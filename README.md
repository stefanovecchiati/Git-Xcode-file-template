# Git-Xcode-file-template
add the template for the file git (read file git there are some instructions or ask to me)


# IMPORTANT:
# for read correctly this file you must write this command on your terminal and dont change the name of the git file
# git config --global core.excludesfile ~/Xcode.gitignore

By launching this command, you're going to read all the files named that Xcode.gitignore as if they were just the gitistore, so go ignore the name

ATTENTION: if you cahnge the name of the file, you must lunch the comand with the name that you put

git config --global core.excludesfile ~/(NAME_FILE).gitignore
